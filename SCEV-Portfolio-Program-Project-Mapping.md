# Comprehensive Review and Mapping of Legacy Documentation

This document provides a detailed review and breakdown of the legacy `README (Business Strategic Plan)` for the Self-Charging Electric Vehicle (SCEV) initiative, mapping each aspect into the formal three-tiered structure of Portfolio, Program, and Project management.

## 1. Portfolio Level: The Enterprise ("Why We Exist")

This level captures the highest strategic intent of the business entity, defining the long-term vision and fundamental principles for the organization.

**A. Vision, Mission, and Purpose Statements**
- Vision: "To be the global leader in sustainable transportation..." / "Inspiring a future of autonomous energy..."
- Mission: "Our mission is to design, build, and deliver innovative self-charging electric vehicles..."
- Purpose: "We exist to create a world where transportation is energy-independent and environmentally sound..."

**B. Core Values**
- Identified Values: Innovation, Sustainability, Safety, Integrity, Customer Centricity, Quality, Collaboration, Adaptability, Respect, Leadership.
- Value Analysis: Prioritization, cost implication analysis, and alignment with Big Five personality traits are portfolio-level activities that define the desired corporate culture and leadership profile.

**C. High-Level Governance**
- Board of Directors: Structure (Chairman, Vice Chairman, Lead Director) provides governance over the entire portfolio of programs.

## 2. Program Level: The Initiative ("How We Will Do It")

This level captures the strategic plan for a major initiativeâ€”in this case, the SCEV Customer Experience (CX) Program.

**A. Strategic Plan & Business Case**
- Program Components: Technology Development, User Experience, Market Penetration, Brand Positioning, Financial Planning, Customer Engagement, Scalability, Adaptability.
- Executive Summary: The plan to design, develop, and market the SCEV is the executive summary for the Program Business Case.

**B. Program Governance & Leadership**
- Executive Leadership (C-Suite): Roles and responsibilities for CEO, CFO, COO, CMO, CTO.
- Organizational Structure: Org charts and department descriptions (R&D, Engineering, Production, Marketing, etc.).

**C. High-Level Program Roadmap**
- Program Phases: "Technology Incubation & Integration," "Market Entry & Growth," "Scalability & Expansion."

## 3. Project Level: The Execution ("What We Will Build")

This level captures the specific, tactical work required to produce deliverables for the program.

**A. Specific Project Work: Energy Harvesting Optimization**
- Project Name: "Kinetic Energy Harvesting Optimization Study" (under Project Kinetix within SCEV CX Program)
- Project Charter Elements:
    - Problem Statement: "Harnessing energy from the rotational motion of the wheel... to power the TPMS."
    - Goal: "Maximize electrical power generation while ensuring the pendulum weight doesn't negatively impact the wheel's balance."
    - Methodology: Theoretical Modeling, Simulation, Experimental Validation.
    - Key Considerations: Wideband Harvesting, Wheel Dynamics, TPMS Requirements.
    - Action Items: 17 specific tasks (e.g., "Develop a mathematical model," "Build a prototype").
