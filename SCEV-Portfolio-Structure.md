- **Program Level:** Defines major initiatives (like CX) that deliver on the portfolio vision through coordinated projects.
- **Project Level:** Each program is broken down into projects, each with a clear mission and deliverables. Projects may have constituent sub-projects focused on specific technologies or business outcomes.

This structure ensures clear accountability, traceability, and alignment from strategic vision to technical execution, enabling the SCEV program to deliver a truly energy-autonomous vehicle ecosystem and customer experience.
