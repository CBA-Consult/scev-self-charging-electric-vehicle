# Project Summary & Goals: Project Dynamo

## Project Overview
Project Dynamo focuses on advanced energy management and optimization for self-charging electric vehicles (SCEV). The project aims to develop intelligent control systems that maximize energy harvesting, storage, and usage efficiency across all SCEV models.

## Strategic Goals
- Develop AI-driven energy management systems for SCEV
- Enhance battery performance and lifecycle
- Integrate regenerative braking and kinetic harvesting technologies
- Support seamless energy flow between vehicle and grid

## Key Milestones
- Prototype intelligent energy management system (Year 1)
- Pilot integration with SCEV chassis (Year 2)
- Full deployment in production vehicles (Year 3)

## Success Metrics
- 10% increase in energy autonomy per vehicle
- 20% improvement in battery lifecycle
- Successful V2G (vehicle-to-grid) integration

## Alignment
Project Dynamo supports the Genesis Programâ€™s mission of energy autonomy, innovation, and sustainability in the SCEV sector.
