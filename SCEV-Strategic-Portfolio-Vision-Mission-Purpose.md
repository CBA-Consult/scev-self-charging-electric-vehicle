# Project Contributions to Energy Autonomy

Below is the updated breakdown of all key projects, including `Project: Flux`, and their contributions to the holistic goal of energy autonomy.

| Project Name | Primary Contribution | Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for Energy Autonomy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Project: Flux** | **Autonomous Energy Replenishment** | **Energy Impact:** Eliminates manual work in the EV energy lifecycle: plugging in the car. Enables effortless, autonomous refueling and maximizes grid interaction. <br><br> **Contributions:** <br> 1.  **Seamless Charging:** High-efficiency (>94%) wireless inductive charging system that auto-engages when parked over a compatible pad. <br> 2.  **Dynamic Charging Readiness:** Compatible with future in-road, dynamic charging standards. <br> 3.  **Alignment Tolerance:** Reliable charge connection even with up to 15cm of parking misalignment. <br><br> **KPIs:** <br> • **Grid-to-Battery Efficiency:** Target > 94%. <br> • **Power Transfer Rate:** Target > 11 kW (Level 2) for static charging. <br> • **Positional Misalignment Tolerance:** Target successful charge initiation with up to 15cm lateral misalignment. |
| **Project: Bedrock** | **Radical Efficiency & Lightweighting**| **KPIs:** <br> • **Vehicle Base Energy Consumption:** Target < 15 kWh / 100 km. <br> • **Total Vehicle Mass:** Target < 1,800 kg. |
| **Project: Guardian (BMS)** | **Loss Prevention & Longevity** | **KPIs:** <br> • **Round-trip Efficiency:** Target > 98%. <br> • **Battery Degradation Rate:** Target < 8% over 10 years / 300,000 km. |
| **Project: Synapse (IPMS)** | **Intelligent Energy Orchestration**| **KPIs:** <br> • **Range Increase from AI Optimization:** Target a 10-15% range improvement over a non-intelligent system. |
| **Project: Nexus (V2H/V2G)** | **Ecosystem Energy Value** | **KPIs:** <br> • **Daily Household Grid Reduction:** Target offsetting 50-70% of peak home energy usage. |
| **Project: Connect & Journey** | **Behavioral Efficiency** | **KPIs:** <br> • **User Engagement with Efficiency Features:** Target > 75% of users actively using the energy dashboard. |
| **Project: Solari** | **Ambient Energy Generation** | **KPIs:** <br> • **Average Daily kWh Generation:** Target 1.2 kWh. |
