# Create Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

This document outlines the process for creating a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) for Project Maglev, following the program-level approach and tailored to project-specific deliverables.

## 1. Purpose
To define and organize the work required to achieve Project Maglev's objectives.

## 2. WBS Development Approach
- Hierarchical decomposition of project deliverables
- Use of numbering system (e.g., 1.1, 1.1.1)
- Integration with schedule and cost management plans
- Iterative review and updates

## 3. Project-Specific WBS Example
| WBS ID | Deliverable/Work Package                | Description                          | Responsible | Duration (hrs) | Dependencies |
|--------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------|---------------|--------------|
| 1      | Maglev Strategic Business Case          | Overall project                      | Project Mgr | 40            | -            |
| 1.1    | Energy Storage Cost-Benefit Analysis    | Analyze energy storage options       | Eng Team    | 60            | 1            |
| 1.2    | Technology Development                  | Develop core technology              | Tech Lead   | 120           | 1            |
| 1.2.1  | Prototype Design                       | Design prototype                     | Eng Team    | 40            | 1.2          |
| 1.2.2  | Prototype Testing                      | Test prototype                       | Eng Team    | 40            | 1.2          |
| 1.3    | Financial Planning                      | Develop financial models             | Fin Lead    | 40            | 1            |

## 4. Recommendations & Enhancements
- Use hierarchical numbering for clarity
- Link WBS to schedule and cost management plans
- Review and update WBS as scope evolves
