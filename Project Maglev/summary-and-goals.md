## Executive Summary
Project Maglev explores the application of magnetic levitation and advanced propulsion technologies in self-charging electric vehicles. The mission is to enhance vehicle efficiency, ride quality, and energy recovery through innovative maglev systems and integration with EV platforms.

## Project Goals
- Research and prototype maglev energy production and energy capture capabilities.
- Research and develop the energy capturing based on frictionless ball bearings
- Having maglev technology be integrated to create frictionless areas where drag is not allowed.
- Research and prototype maglev suspension and propulsion systems for EVs.
- Evaluate energy recovery and ride quality improvements.
- Assess integration feasibility with current and future EV architectures.
- Ensure safety and compliance with transportation standards.

## Core Values & Their Integration
