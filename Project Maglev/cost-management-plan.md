**Version:** 1.1  
**Last Updated:** August 29, 2025

---

## 1. Purpose
Defines policies, processes, and tools for planning, estimating, budgeting, managing, and controlling costs throughout the Project Maglev lifecycle. Supports delivery of strategic objectives, innovation, and financial transparency.

## 2. Cost Management Approach
- **Estimation:** Bottom-up and parametric estimation using WBS, resource rates, and technology costs.
- **Budgeting:** Aggregate estimates to establish an authorized baseline, aligned with investment plans.
- **Control:** Monitor actuals vs. estimates, manage variances, forecast, and report regularly.
- **Value Realization:** Track cost benefits against projected value and ROI.

## 3. Cost Estimation
- **Categories:** Personnel, technology, infrastructure, training, consulting, compliance, contingency.
- **Methodology:** WBS decomposition, resource rates, benchmarking, vendor quotes, contingency for risk.

## 4. Cost Baseline
- Establish baseline by phase (e.g., R&D, pilot, production).
- Allocate costs by deliverable, domain, and timeline.

### Budget Allocation Table
| Phase         | Deliverable/Domain      | Budget Amount (TBD) | Cost Element         | Source Reference         |
|--------------|------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| R&D          | Technology Assessment  | [To be determined]   | Technology, Personnel| WBS, Resource Plan      |
| Pilot        | Prototype Development  | [To be determined]   | Infrastructure, Consulting | WBS, Resource Plan      |
| Production   | Full Deployment        | [To be determined]   | Operations, Training | WBS, Resource Plan      |
| Contingency  | Risk Management        | [To be determined]   | Contingency          | WBS, Resource Plan      |

This table provides placeholders for budget amounts, which will be finalized after completion of the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and resource planning. It ensures transparency and traceability for future financial allocations and supports financial control and reporting. Adjustments should be made as actuals are tracked and variances are managed.

## 5. Funding Requirements
- **Sources:** Internal capital, grants, innovation funds, contingency reserves.
- **Classification:** CapEx for assets, OpEx for operations.

## 6. Cost Control & Monitoring
- **Tracking:** Monthly actuals vs. baseline, variance analysis, value realization tracking.
- **Governance:** Cost dashboard integration, monthly stakeholder reporting, audit trail, change control for >$10,000.

## 7. Unique Project Cost Considerations
- **Sustainability:** ESG measurement, green tech premiums, reporting compliance.
- **Innovation:** Premium rates for R&D, technology assessment, regulatory compliance.
- **Risk:** Contingency management, trigger conditions, approval process.

## 8. Value Realization & ROI Tracking
- **KPIs:** Cost variance, CPI, budget utilization, value realization rate, ROI by phase, financial KPIs specific to Project Maglev.
- **Reporting:** Weekly team tracking, monthly council report, quarterly executive dashboard, annual cost-benefit analysis.
