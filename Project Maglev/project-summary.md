# Project Summary & Goals: Project Maglev

## Project Overview
Project Maglev explores the application of magnetic levitation and advanced suspension technologies for self-charging electric vehicles (SCEV). The project aims to enhance vehicle efficiency, ride quality, and energy savings through innovative maglev systems.

## Strategic Goals
- Develop maglev-based suspension for SCEV platforms
- Improve energy efficiency and reduce mechanical losses
- Enhance ride comfort and vehicle stability
- Research scalable maglev solutions for mass-market EVs

## Key Milestones
- Maglev suspension prototype (Year 1)
- Vehicle integration and testing (Year 2)
- Commercial deployment (Year 3)

## Success Metrics
- 5% reduction in energy consumption per vehicle
- Superior ride comfort ratings
- Scalable maglev adoption in SCEV models

## Alignment
Project Maglev supports the Genesis Programâ€™s commitment to innovation, quality, and sustainable mobility.
