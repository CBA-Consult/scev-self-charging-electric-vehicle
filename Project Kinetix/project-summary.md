# Project Summary & Goals: Project Kinetix

## Project Overview
Project Kinetix is dedicated to developing wideband kinetic energy harvesting systems for self-charging electric vehicles (SCEV). The project aims to optimize energy capture from vehicle motion, vibration, and other dynamic sources.

## Strategic Goals
- Design and implement advanced kinetic energy harvesters
- Maximize energy output across variable driving conditions
- Integrate harvesting systems with SCEV battery management
- Support research in multi-directional energy harvesting

## Key Milestones
- Kinetic harvester prototype (Year 1)
- System integration and testing (Year 2)
- Full deployment in SCEV models (Year 3)

## Success Metrics
- 8% increase in harvested energy per vehicle
- Reliable operation across all driving environments
- Successful integration with battery management systems

## Alignment
Project Kinetix advances the Genesis Programâ€™s goals of innovation, sustainability, and energy autonomy.
