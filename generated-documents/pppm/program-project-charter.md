### **1.0 Program Purpose and Justification**

This charter formally authorizes the establishment of the Self-Charging Electric Vehicle (SCEV) Program, codenamed "Project Genesis." The program's core purpose is to architect, engineer, and deliver a new generation of electric vehicles that achieve unprecedented energy autonomy. These vehicles will be designed to intelligently generate, store, and manage electrical energy from a variety of renewable sources, aiming to arrive at their destination with a near-full or full state of charge under typical usage conditions.

The justification for this program is rooted in addressing key barriers to EV adoption, namely range anxiety and charging infrastructure dependency.[[1](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fvertexaisearch.cloud.google.com%2Fgrounding-api-redirect%2FAUZIYQFbcVdEqtMF44l2u12_g385GTeStSVb2j-7hK59A74IBmWOSNoe4ypn8W8JoJ6pRTf8twT3PkycxzdMroPNRyiro7-ES7901eeL7UM7doISRhbCtOFbxxjxcV9regzXDxYSo_NojJJnCQ9t8a5dKHiCG2NqfFnO6P78Yc_eBdkLqxRGej8pVF4b4XwsKo2DvVEbZYk%3D)][[2](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fvertexaisearch.cloud.google.com%2Fgrounding-api-redirect%2FAUZIYQHgzpX5HfVieCFT2_u3j9LifdNVVljwgZy7vQGmJ_OqXd7M7S7zsuPBUKnir-gvNtqwOQ71dSEipW7AoXYam_ca-8iPLh-s5WVsYoXQB4C85x4jIjA0Z-UeqJC4YgZKXMiY3cRTc52Had4Um1fQbBpMdVER8RjaJqP1u0sXibFiY_sM)] By developing vehicles capable of significant self-charging, we aim to redefine the electric vehicle ownership experience, creating a significant competitive advantage and positioning our organization as a leader in sustainable and innovative mobility solutions. Furthermore, the program's focus on bidirectional grid interaction will unlock new revenue streams and contribute to a more resilient and sustainable energy ecosystem.
