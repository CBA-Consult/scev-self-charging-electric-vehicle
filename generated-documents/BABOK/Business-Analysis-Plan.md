# Business Analysis Plan Template

This document provides a comprehensive template for a business analysis plan, covering all key sections typically included:

## 1. Introduction
- Purpose: This business analysis plan supports the SCEV Strategic Business Plan, guiding the development and launch of self-charging electric vehicles (SCEVs) that revolutionize personal transportation by eliminating range anxiety and dependence on external charging infrastructure.
- Scope: The plan covers all phases from proof of concept and prototype development, through market entry and growth, to international expansion and sustainable revenue models.
- Context: The SCEV project aligns with the company's strategic objective to become a global leader in sustainable transportation by 2030, leveraging advanced solar energy harvesting, battery management, and maglev technology for energy autonomy and customer convenience.

## 2. Business Analysis Approach
- The business analysis approach is flexible and project-specific. Each project within the SCEV program may select agile, waterfall, hybrid, scrum, or another methodology as appropriate. The enterprise default is an agile-waterfall hybrid with 2-week sprints, supporting iterative development and structured delivery. The approach is documented and justified for each project, ensuring alignment with objectives, complexity, and stakeholder needs.

## 3. Stakeholder Analysis
- Stakeholders include: PMO Director (Executive Sponsor), Project Manager, engineering teams, product owners, QA, end users, suppliers, distribution partners, and regulatory bodies.
- Roles: PMO Director authorizes and sponsors the project; Project Manager leads execution; engineering teams develop technology; product owners define requirements; QA ensures quality; end users provide feedback; suppliers and partners support production and distribution; regulatory bodies ensure compliance.
- Engagement: Stakeholder engagement is ongoing, with regular reviews, feedback sessions, and transparent communication to ensure alignment and address needs.

## 4. Business Analysis Activities and Deliverables
- Activities: Requirements elicitation (workshops, interviews, document analysis), requirements analysis and validation, traceability mapping, solution design, risk assessment, and performance monitoring.
- Deliverables: Requirements documentation, traceability matrix, user stories, acceptance criteria, business case, project charter, prototype specifications, market analysis, financial projections, and go-to-market strategy.
- Timeline: Phased approachâ€”Phase 1 (Years 1-3): Proof of concept and prototype; Phase 2 (Years 4-6): MVP and market entry; Phase 3 (Years 7-10): Growth, expansion, and revenue model.

## 5. Requirements Management Process
- Documentation follows company standards for clarity, completeness, and traceability. Requirements are version-controlled and mapped in a traceability matrix. Prioritization is based on strategic objectives, technical feasibility, and market needs. Approval is obtained from the Project Manager and Executive Sponsor. Change management is proactive, with impact analysis and stakeholder communication for all changes.

## 6. Communication Plan
- Communication is structured and regular: weekly project meetings, monthly executive reviews, and ad hoc stakeholder sessions. Reporting includes status updates, risk assessments, and milestone tracking. Stakeholder needs are addressed through transparent, timely, and tailored communication.

## 7. Tools, Techniques, and Technology
- Elicitation: Workshops, interviews, document analysis, and market research.
- Tools: Confluence for documentation, Jira for requirements and issue tracking, markdown files for technical and business documentation.

## 8. Performance Monitoring and Reporting
- Metrics: Prototype milestones, funding secured, market awareness, customer pre-orders, technical efficiency, and financial ROI.
- Reviews: Regular progress reviews, milestone assessments, and KPI tracking.
- Issues and risks: Managed through a risk register, with mitigation strategies and escalation procedures.

## 9. Risk Management
- Risks: Technological challenges, market acceptance, competition, supply chain disruptions, regulatory hurdles.
- Mitigation: Phased development, rigorous testing, strategic partnerships, diversified suppliers, proactive regulatory engagement, and contingency planning.

## 10. Approval and Sign-off
- Deliverables are reviewed and approved by the Project Manager and Executive Sponsor. Formal sign-off is documented for all major deliverables, ensuring accountability and alignment with business objectives.
