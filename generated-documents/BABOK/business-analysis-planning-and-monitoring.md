## Business Analysis Approach
For the SCEV program, the business analysis approach is flexible and tailored to the needs of each project within the program and portfolio. Each project may select the methodology that best fits its objectives, complexity, and stakeholder needs. Options include:

- Agile
- Waterfall
- Hybrid (combining agile and waterfall elements)
- Scrum
- Other business analysis methodologies as appropriate

**Enterprise Default:**
- The default company approach is an agile-waterfall hybrid, supporting iterative development and structured delivery.
- Sprints are set to a 2-week cycle for agile activities, enabling regular review, feedback, and adaptation.

The selected approach should be documented in the business analysis plan for each project, with justification for the choice and alignment to project goals. This ensures that business analysis activities are effective, efficient, and responsive to the unique requirements of each initiative.

**Key Principles:**
- Methodology selection is project-specific and may differ across the program.
- The approach should support clear requirements gathering, stakeholder engagement, and traceability.
- Flexibility is encouraged to maximize value and adapt to changing needs.

This working file outlines the steps and plan for utilizing the BABOK Business Analysis Planning and Monitoring knowledge area to fulfill requirements mapping and gathering for the SCEV project.

## 1. Define Business Analysis Approach
- Select methodology (e.g., hybrid agile-waterfall) suitable for SCEV.
- Document the approach in a business analysis plan.

## 2. Identify and Analyze Stakeholders
- List all stakeholders (engineers, product owners, QA, end users, etc.).
- Document their interests, influence, and requirements needs.

## 3. Plan Requirements Management
### Requirements Management Process

- **Documentation:** Use standardized templates for requirements (functional, non-functional, stakeholder needs) in markdown and Confluence. Ensure each requirement is uniquely identified and linked to source documents.
- **Traceability:** Maintain a living Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) that maps requirements to stakeholder needs, deliverables, acceptance criteria, and test cases. Reference the RTM in `requirements-traceability-matrix.md` and stakeholder mapping in `stakeholder-requirements-needs.md`.
- **Prioritization:** Apply MoSCoW or similar prioritization techniques. Document priorities in the RTM and review with stakeholders during planning sessions.
- **Approval:** Define a formal review and sign-off process. Use version-controlled documents and record approvals in Confluence or via tracked markdown changes.
- **Approval:**
	   - Establish a formal review and sign-off workflow:
		   - **Roles & Responsibilities:**
			   - Business Analyst: Prepares and submits requirements for review.
			   - Project Manager: Coordinates review meetings, tracks approval status, and has emergency budget approval authority up to $100,000 for urgent project needs.
			   - Engineering Lead / QA Lead: Reviews technical and test requirements.
			   - PMO Director / Executive Sponsor: Provides final approval and financial sign-off, and must approve any emergency budget escalation above $100,000.
		- **Review Process:**
			- Requirements are reviewed in scheduled meetings, with feedback documented in the version-controlled markdown files.
			- Approvals are recorded by updating the status field and adding an approval log entry (date, approver, comments).
		- **Financial Sign-Off:**
			- All requirements and deliverables with budget impact require explicit financial approval from the PMO Director or Executive Sponsor.
			- Financial sign-off is logged in the requirements registry and deliverables registry.
		- **Escalation Procedures:**
			   - If approval is delayed or blocked, escalate to the next level of management (e.g., PMO Director, CFO) within 2 business days.
			   - For urgent project needs, the Project Manager may approve expenditures up to $100,000. Any emergency budget request above this threshold requires immediate escalation and approval from the PMO Director and Executive Sponsor.
			   - Emergency escalation procedures are triggered for critical path items or strict financial reporting deadlines.
		- **Reporting Deadlines:**
			- All financial approvals and sign-offs must be completed by the monthly financial reporting deadline.
			- Status and audit logs are reviewed for transparency and compliance.
		- **Transparency:**
			- All approval and sign-off actions are tracked in the git history and documented in the markdown files for full auditability.
- **Version Control:** Store all requirements documents in the project repository with clear versioning. Use Git for change tracking and history. Update the RTM and requirements docs with each approved change.

**Artifacts:**
- `requirements-traceability-matrix.md`: Central RTM linking requirements, stakeholder needs, deliverables, and KPIs.
- `stakeholder-requirements-needs.md`: Stakeholder requirements mapping.
- `user-stories.md`, `tech-acceptance-criteria.md`: User stories and acceptance criteria.
- Confluence/Jira: For collaborative review, approval, and change management.

**Best Practices:**
- Review and update requirements regularly with stakeholders.
- Ensure traceability from business objectives to testable deliverables.
- Use version control to manage changes and maintain audit trails.

## 4. Determine Deliverables and Timeline
- List all business analysis deliverables (requirements docs, traceability matrix, user stories, acceptance criteria).
- Create a timeline and assign responsibilities for each deliverable.

## 5. Select Tools and Techniques
- Choose elicitation techniques (workshops, interviews, document analysis).
- Select documentation and collaboration tools (Confluence, Jira, markdown files).

## 6. Monitor and Report Progress

## 7. Manage Changes
