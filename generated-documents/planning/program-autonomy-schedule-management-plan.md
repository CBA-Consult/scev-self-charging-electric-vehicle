# Program Autonomy Schedule Management Plan

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** August 29, 2025

---

## 1. Strategic Objectives
- Lead the industry in autonomous energy with self-charging electric vehicles by 2030
- Engineer EVs that exceed safety standards and harness renewable energy efficiently
- Empower a sustainable future with self-charging capabilities and energy autonomy
- Drive innovation, sustainability, and market awareness
- Achieve measurable sustainability metrics and continuous improvement
- Develop modular, scalable vehicle platforms
- Foster cross-disciplinary collaboration and agile project management

## 2. Scheduling Approach
- Define high-level milestones for each strategic objective
- Break down objectives into actionable tasks and deliverables
- Estimate durations for each task using expert judgment and historical data
- Determine dependencies between tasks and milestones
- Use Gantt charts and network diagrams for timeline visualization
- Review and update schedule regularly to reflect progress and changes

## 3. High-Level Milestones & Tasks
| Milestone                          | Key Tasks                                      | Estimated Duration | Dependencies                |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|
| Industry Leadership by 2030        | Vision definition, market analysis, prototyping | 12 months         | None                        |
| Safety & Renewable Energy          | Safety design, renewable integration, testing   | 18 months         | Industry Leadership         |
| Sustainability & Autonomy          | ESG metrics, energy autonomy R&D                | 12 months         | Safety & Renewable Energy   |
| Modular Platform Development       | Platform architecture, modular design           | 14 months         | Sustainability & Autonomy   |
| Collaboration & Agile Management   | Team formation, agile training, process setup   | 6 months          | Modular Platform Development|
| Continuous Improvement             | Feedback loops, open-source governance          | Ongoing           | All milestones              |

## 4. Schedule Estimation & Management
- Use rolling wave planning for detailed task estimation as objectives progress
- Apply expert judgment, historical data, and parametric estimation for durations
- Identify and manage critical path to ensure timely achievement of strategic objectives
- Monitor progress using schedule performance indicators (SPI, milestone completion rate)
- Update schedule monthly and communicate changes to stakeholders

## 5. Timeline Management
- Use project management software for schedule tracking and visualization
- Hold monthly schedule review meetings
- Document and manage schedule risks and mitigation actions
- Maintain a change log for schedule adjustments

## 6. Reporting & Governance
- Report schedule status to Board of Directors and key stakeholders
- Align schedule management with program values and long-term goals
- Ensure schedule transparency and accountability
