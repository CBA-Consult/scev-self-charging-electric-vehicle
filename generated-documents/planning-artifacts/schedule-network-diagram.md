## 1. Network Diagram Description
The schedule network diagram visually represents the flow and dependencies of major project activities. Below is a textual representation of the activity relationships:

```
[Identify stakeholders] --> [Gather requirements] --> [Analyze user personas] --> [Document stakeholder needs]
    |
    v
[Draft vision, mission, and purpose statements] --> [Define core values] --> [Conduct market analysis] --> [Develop financial projections] --> [Prepare strategic plan document]
    |
    v
[Identify technology options] --> [Assess feasibility] --> [Develop technology roadmap] --> [Define key milestones]
    |
    v
[Collect financial data] --> [Build financial models] --> [Review and validate projections]
    |
    v
[Plan manufacturing processes] --> [Develop supply chain strategy] --> [Define distribution channels]
    |
    v
[Develop branding strategy] --> [Plan marketing campaigns] --> [Define customer engagement tactics]
    |
    v
[Identify risks] --> [Analyze risk impact] --> [Develop mitigation strategies]
    |
    v
[Identify regulatory requirements] --> [Prepare compliance documentation]
    |
    v
[Develop training resources] --> [Prepare support documentation]
    |
    v
[Collect stakeholder feedback] --> [Prepare engagement reports]
```

## 2. Key Dependencies
- Requirements collection must precede strategic planning and technology roadmap activities.
- Financial modeling depends on market analysis and requirements documentation.
- Operational planning follows strategic and financial planning.
- Marketing and risk management activities are dependent on strategic and operational planning.
- Compliance and training activities follow operational and risk planning.
