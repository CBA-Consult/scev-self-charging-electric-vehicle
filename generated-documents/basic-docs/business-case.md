# Business Case: Self-Charging Electric Vehicle (SCEV) Strategic Plan

**Menno Drescher | August 27, 2025**

**Vision:** Empowering the future of mobility with self-charging electric vehicles that ensure a fully charged arrival, combining cutting-edge technology with sustainable practices to redefine the driving experience.


## 1. Executive Summary

This business case supports the SCEV Initiative, a strategic project to develop and commercialize a revolutionary electric vehicle that eliminates range anxiety and the inconvenience of traditional charging. By integrating advanced energy harvesting technologies—including optimized regenerative braking, solar panels, and electromagnetic induction systems—the SCEV will offer unparalleled convenience and sustainability. The project aligns with our mission to lead the automotive industry towards energy-independent, sustainable mobility. We project a positive ROI within 8 years of market entry, capturing a significant share of the premium EV market by 2031 and establishing our brand as a leader in transportation innovation.


## 2. Problem Definition & Business Need

The widespread adoption of electric vehicles is fundamentally constrained by consumer "range anxiety" and the dependency on a still-developing charging infrastructure. This friction point represents a significant barrier to the transition towards sustainable transportation. Addressing this unmet need is critical to capturing significant market share and establishing leadership in the evolving sustainable transportation sector.


## 3. Proposed Solution

The SCEV will utilize integrated solar panels, advanced battery management systems, and breakthrough electromagnetic induction and maglev energy harvesting to provide continuous charging during operation. The technology suite includes:
- Optimized regenerative braking
- Photovoltaic energy generation
- Suspension and maglev energy harvesting
- Intelligent power management and real-time data display

The target market includes premium electric vehicle manufacturers, high-performance automotive segments, and fleet operators seeking maximum energy efficiency. This approach directly addresses consumer concerns about range and charging infrastructure, offering a superior user experience and a compelling value proposition.


## 4. Strategic Alignment

This initiative is in direct alignment with our core organizational values and strategic goals:
- **Mission:** To engineer and deliver SCEVs that redefine personal transportation by seamlessly integrating renewable energy and prioritizing safety.
- **Vision:** To lead the global automotive industry towards energy independence and effortless, sustainable mobility by 2031.
- **Core Values:** Unwavering Safety, Sustainable Innovation, Customer-Driven Excellence, Adaptive Leadership.

## 10. Technology Readiness Level (TRL)

The In Wheel Frictionless Maglev Technology is currently at TRL 3 (experimental proof of concept). Initial lab tests have validated the core principles of magnetic levitation and energy harvesting. The next steps include building a functional prototype (TRL 4-5), followed by pilot testing in real-world conditions (TRL 6-7). Advancement to higher TRLs will require additional R&D, iterative prototyping, and validation.

## 11. Target Market Specificity

Primary target segments include:
- Premium electric vehicle manufacturers seeking differentiation and advanced energy solutions.
- High-performance automotive segments focused on efficiency and innovation.
- Fleet operators (urban delivery, logistics) prioritizing energy autonomy and operational cost reduction.

The initial go-to-market strategy will focus on premium EV manufacturers, leveraging their early adoption potential and brand influence. Subsequent phases will expand to fleet operators and broader automotive markets.
