# Business Case: Self-Charging Electric Vehicle (SCEV) Strategic Plan

**Menno Drescher | June 19, 2024**

**Vision:** Empowering the future of mobility with self-charging electric vehicles that ensure a fully charged arrival, combining cutting-edge technology with sustainable practices to redefine the driving experience.


## 1. Executive Summary

This business case proposes a strategic plan for developing and launching a self-charging electric vehicle (SCEV).  The plan leverages advancements in photovoltaic cells, battery management systems, and AI to create vehicles that harvest solar energy and optimize power consumption, eliminating range anxiety and reducing reliance on traditional charging infrastructure.  Key benefits include enhanced customer convenience, a strong competitive advantage, and a significant contribution to environmental sustainability.  Initial investment is estimated at $50 million for R&D and initial production, with projected ROI exceeding 20% within five years based on conservative sales projections of 10,000 units annually by year five.  We recommend proceeding with the project given its strong strategic alignment with our core values and substantial market potential.


## 2. Problem Definition & Business Need

The current electric vehicle market suffers from range anxiety and a dependence on limited charging infrastructure.  This restricts market penetration and limits the appeal of EVs to a wider consumer base.  Competitors are focusing primarily on battery technology improvements, leaving a significant opportunity for a disruptive technology like self-charging.  Addressing this unmet need is critical to capturing significant market share and establishing leadership in the evolving sustainable transportation sector.  Failure to act decisively risks losing market position to competitors and missing a crucial window of opportunity.


## 3. Proposed Solution

This project outlines a comprehensive strategic plan to develop and launch a self-charging electric vehicle featuring revolutionary In Wheel Frictionless Maglev Technology. The SCEV will utilize integrated solar panels, advanced battery management systems, and breakthrough magnetic levitation energy harvesting to eliminate friction and drag while providing continuous charging during operation. The maglev technology reduces energy losses by 95% and improves overall efficiency by 25-35%. The target market includes premium electric vehicle manufacturers, high-performance automotive segments, and fleet operators seeking maximum energy efficiency. This innovative approach directly addresses the critical need for friction reduction and enhanced energy production in electric vehicles.s consumer concerns about range and charging infrastructure, offering a superior user experience and a compelling value proposition.


## 4. Strategic Alignment

This project directly aligns with our core strategic goals of innovation, sustainability, and customer centricity. The development of self-charging technology represents a significant leap forward in automotive innovation, solidifying our position as a market leader.  The SCEV’s reliance on renewable energy sources directly supports our commitment to environmental sustainability.  By eliminating range anxiety and providing unprecedented convenience, the SCEV will enhance customer satisfaction and build brand loyalty, further strengthening our customer-centric approach.  The project also aligns with our core values of quality, integrity, collaboration, adaptability, respect, and leadership.


## 5. Financial Analysis

**Estimated Costs:**

*   **One-Time Costs:** $50 million (R&D: $30 million, initial production tooling and setup: $20 million)
*   **Recurring Costs:**  $10 million annually (marketing, sales, and operational expenses)

**Projected Benefits:**

*   **Quantitative:**  Based on a projected selling price of $50,000 per vehicle and conservative sales projections of 10,000 units annually by year five, annual revenue will reach $500 million.  Cost savings from reduced charging infrastructure dependence are estimated at $5 million annually.
*   **Qualitative:**  Improved brand image, enhanced customer loyalty, significant competitive advantage in a rapidly growing market segment.

**Return on Investment (ROI) Projection:**  Based on the estimated costs and projected benefits, we project an ROI exceeding 20% within five years.  This projection assumes a successful product launch, consistent market growth, and effective marketing and sales strategies.
