# User Stories: Self-Charging Electric Vehicle (SCEV) Business Strategic Plan

## Project Overview

**Project:** Development of a Business Strategic Plan for a Self-Charging Electric Vehicle (SCEV)

**Goal:** To create a comprehensive plan outlining the vision, mission, and strategies for a company designing and marketing SCEVs that arrive home fully charged, emphasizing innovation, sustainability, and a superior user experience.  The plan will cover technology development, market penetration, brand positioning, financial planning, and customer engagement, with a target for market awareness by 2030.

## User Story Format

Each user story follows the format: "As a [user type], I want [functionality] so that [benefit]."  Acceptance criteria will follow the Given-When-Then format.


## Epic 1: Technology Development & Optimization

**Theme:**  Developing and refining the self-charging technology, including energy harvesting and battery management.

    - **Given:** A simulation model of the energy harvesting system.
    - **When:** I input various driving conditions.
    - **Then:** The model accurately predicts power generation and identifies optimal parameters.

    - **Given:** Samples of different photovoltaic materials.
    - **When:** I conduct tests under controlled conditions (sunlight intensity, temperature).
    - **Then:**  I can compare their efficiency, durability, and cost-effectiveness.

- **US004:** As a Battery Engineer, I want to design a robust battery management system (BMS) to ensure optimal battery life and safety so that the vehicle maintains performance and safety over its lifespan.
    - **Given:** A battery pack and a BMS prototype.
    - **When:** I conduct various charge/discharge cycles under different conditions.
    - **Then:** The BMS accurately monitors and controls battery parameters (voltage, temperature, current) and prevents safety hazards.

- **US005:** As a Systems Engineer, I want to integrate all the self-charging components (solar panels, regenerative braking, etc.) seamlessly into the vehicle's architecture so that the system functions reliably and efficiently as a whole.
    - **Given:** Fully functional individual components.
    - **When:** I integrate all components into the vehicle design.
    - **Then:** The system functions reliably and efficiently, meeting all performance targets.

     - **US014:** As a Quality Assurance Engineer, I want to simulate failure modes in the self-charging system (e.g., a damaged solar panel or a faulty regenerative braking sensor) so that I can verify the system's safety protocols and ensure it fails gracefully without compromising vehicle operation.
         - **Given:** A test vehicle with the integrated self-charging system in a controlled environment.
         - **When:** A failure is simulated in one of the energy harvesting components.
         - **Then:** The system safely isolates the faulty component, logs an error, and alerts the driver without causing a critical failure in the vehicle's primary functions (like propulsion or braking).


## Epic 2: User Experience and Interface Design

**Theme:** Creating an intuitive and user-friendly experience for the driver and passengers.

- **US006:** As a UX Designer, I want to design a clear and informative dashboard display so that the driver can easily monitor the vehicle's charge level, energy generation, and other relevant data.
    - **Given:** User research data on driver preferences.
    - **When:** The user interacts with the dashboard.
    - **Then:** The driver can easily understand and interpret all displayed information.

- **US007:** As a UI Developer, I want to create a mobile application that allows users to remotely monitor and manage vehicle functions (e.g., pre-conditioning, charging scheduling) so that users can optimize the vehicle's performance and convenience.
    - **Given:** A functional backend system and API.
    - **When:** The user interacts with the mobile app.
    - **Then:** The user can remotely access and control vehicle functions.

     - **US015:** As a driver, I want the vehicle's navigation system to forecast my net energy balance for a planned route, considering factors like terrain, weather, and traffic, so that I can confidently undertake long journeys and know if I'll arrive with more or less charge than I started with.
         - **Given:** The driver has entered a destination more than 50 miles away into the navigation system.
         - **When:** The system calculates the route and retrieves the weather forecast.
         - **Then:** The route summary displays an "Estimated Charge at Arrival," factoring in both projected energy consumption (from driving) and projected energy generation (from solar/regenerative systems).


## Epic 3: Market Strategy and Business Development

**Theme:** Defining the market strategy, including target audiences, pricing, and distribution channels.

- **US008:** As a Market Researcher, I want to conduct surveys and focus groups to understand potential customer preferences and needs so that we can tailor our product and marketing efforts effectively.

    - **When:** I conduct surveys and focus groups.
    - **Then:** I obtain data on customer preferences, needs, and buying behaviors.

- **US009:** As a Sales Manager, I want to develop a sales strategy that targets specific customer segments (e.g., urban commuters, fleet operators) so that we can effectively reach and convert potential customers.
