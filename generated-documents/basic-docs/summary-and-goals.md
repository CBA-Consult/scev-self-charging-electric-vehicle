## Summary and Goals

**Project:** Self-Charging Electric Vehicle (SCEV) - Business Strategic Plan

**Author:** Menno Drescher

**Date:** August 17, 2025

**Version:** 1.0.0

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the strategic vision and plan for a company developing self-charging electric vehicles (SCEVs). Our mission is to revolutionize personal transportation by providing vehicles that arrive home fully charged, eliminating range anxiety and promoting sustainable mobility. This will be achieved through a combination of cutting-edge solar energy harvesting technology, advanced battery management systems, and user-centric design. The plan details key strategic components, including technology development, market penetration, brand building, and financial projections, all underpinned by a commitment to sustainability and operational excellence. The core values driving this plan are Innovation, Sustainability, Safety, Integrity, Customer Centricity, Quality, Collaboration, Adaptability, Respect, and Leadership.

## Project Goals

The overarching goal is to establish a leading position in the self-charging electric vehicle market by 2030. This will be achieved through the successful execution of the following key goals:

### Phase 1: Research & Development (Years 1-3)

- **Technological Breakthrough:** Develop and patent highly efficient self-charging systems exceeding current industry benchmarks in solar energy conversion and energy storage. This includes optimizing photovoltaic cell integration, battery management systems, and energy harvesting from kinetic energy (regenerative braking).  
  - *Metrics:* Achieve energy harvesting efficiency of at least 0.5 kWh per mile driven; ensure all technological breakthroughs are protected by patents as appropriate.
- **Prototype Development:** Design and build a functional prototype SCEV demonstrating the viability of the self-charging technology.  
  - *Metrics:* Complete prototype testing in real-world conditions (weather, road types, driving styles) by Year 3.
- **Intellectual Property:** Secure robust intellectual property protection for core technologies and designs, with patenting decisions made based on the significance and scope of each breakthrough.

### Phase 2: Market Entry & Growth (Years 4-7)

- **Niche Market Penetration:** Target initial market segments with high potential, such as urban commuters, delivery services, and fleet operators.  
  - *Metrics:* Achieve 5% market share in target segments by Year 7.
- **Brand Building:** Establish a strong brand identity that communicates innovation, sustainability, and customer-centricity.  
  - *Metrics:* Reach 70% brand awareness and maintain positive customer sentiment scores.
- **Strategic Partnerships:** Secure strategic partnerships with key players in the automotive supply chain, energy sector, and technology companies.  
  - *Metrics:* Establish at least 5 strategic partnerships by Year 7.

### Phase 3: Scalability & Expansion (Years 8-10)

- **Mass Production:** Establish efficient and scalable manufacturing processes for mass production of SCEVs.  
  - *Metrics:* Achieve cost per unit below $30,000 and production volume of 10,000 units/year by Year 10.
- **Market Expansion:** Expand into broader market segments and international markets.  
  - *Metrics:* Attain global market share of 2% by Year 10.
- **Sustainable Infrastructure:** Contribute to the development of supporting infrastructure for bidirectional energy exchange between vehicles and the power grid, supporting grid stability and sustainability goals.
