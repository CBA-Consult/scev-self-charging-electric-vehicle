## Project Overview

**Project Name:** Development of a Self-Charging Electric Vehicle (SCEV) Business Strategic Plan

**Project Goal:**  Create a comprehensive business strategic plan for a company designing self-charging electric vehicles, aiming for market awareness and initial product launch by 2030.

**Project Description:** This project involves developing a detailed business plan encompassing technology development, user experience design, sustainability strategies, market penetration plans, brand positioning, financial projections, customer engagement strategies, scalability considerations, and adaptability mechanisms for a company focused on self-charging electric vehicles.  The plan will include vision, mission, purpose statements, and core values.  A key element is the development of a self-charging system utilizing renewable energy sources.  A secondary, related project involves researching optimal energy harvesting techniques for a Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) using a pendulum.

## Risk Management Strategy

### Risk Management Approach

A proactive and iterative risk management approach will be employed, aligning with PMBOK Guide standards.  The six risk management processes will be implemented:

1. **Risk Planning:** Defining the risk management process and methodology.
2. **Risk Identification:** Identifying potential risks through various techniques.
3. **Risk Analysis:** Assessing the probability and impact of identified risks.
4. **Risk Response Planning:** Developing strategies to address threats and exploit opportunities.
5. **Risk Response Implementation:** Executing the planned risk responses.
6. **Risk Monitoring and Control:** Tracking risks, monitoring responses, and adapting the plan as needed.


### Risk Tolerance and Thresholds

* **Risk Appetite:** The project has a moderate risk appetite, prioritizing project success while accepting calculated risks that align with the strategic goals.
* **Risk Threshold:** Risks with a probability of 4 (High) or higher AND an impact of 3 (Medium) or higher will require immediate attention.
* **Escalation Criteria:** Risks exceeding the Project Manager's authority (e.g., significant budget overruns, regulatory hurdles) will be escalated to the Project Sponsor.
* **Acceptable Risk Levels:** Low and Medium risks will be managed at the project level using mitigation strategies.  High risks will necessitate more intensive management and potential escalation. Critical risks will require immediate executive action.

## Risk Analysis Framework

### Probability and Impact Scales (Detailed descriptions are provided in Appendix H)

**Probability Scale (1-5):** Very Low, Low, Medium, High, Very High

**Impact Scale (1-5):**  Very Low, Low, Medium, High, Very High (based on cost, schedule, and quality impacts)

### Risk Score Calculation

Risk Score = Probability x Impact

### Risk Priority Matrix (Detailed descriptions are provided in Appendix I)

The Risk Priority Matrix will categorize risks into Low, Medium, High, and Critical based on their risk score.  (See Appendix I for a visual representation.)
