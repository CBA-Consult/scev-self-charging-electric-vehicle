# Requirements Management Plan for Program Autonomy

## Overview
This plan outlines the approach for managing requirements across the Program Autonomy initiative, which consists of the following sub-projects:
- Project Dynamo
- Project Flux
- Project Guardian
- Project Kinetix
- Project Maglev
- Project Nexus
- Project Solari
- Project Synapse

## Objectives
- Ensure all requirements are documented, traceable, and aligned with program goals.
- Integrate user stories, acceptance criteria, stakeholder perspectives, non-functional requirements (NFRs), and definitions of done (DoD) from each sub-project.
- Maintain a requirements traceability matrix to support validation and change management.

## Requirements Gathering
Requirements are sourced from the `user-stories.md` files in each project folder. Each file includes:
- Jira Key and Title
- Core User Stories
- Acceptance Criteria
- Stakeholder Requirements
- Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)
- Traceability and Definition of Done (DoD)

## Traceability Matrix
A requirements traceability matrix will be maintained to map:
- Program-level goals to sub-project requirements
- User stories to acceptance criteria and DoD
- Stakeholder requirements to implementation tasks

## Change Management
- All changes to requirements will be tracked and documented.
- Impact analysis will be performed for any proposed changes.
- Stakeholder approval is required for major changes.

## Validation and Verification
- Requirements will be validated against program goals and stakeholder needs.
- Verification will be performed through reviews, testing, and acceptance criteria.

## Roles and Responsibilities
- Program Manager: Oversees requirements management and traceability.
- Project Leads: Ensure requirements are captured and updated for each sub-project.
- Stakeholders: Review and approve requirements and changes.

## Tools and Documentation
- All requirements and traceability matrices are maintained in markdown files within the workspace.
- Version control is used to track changes and maintain history.

## Next Steps
- Continue to break down requirements as needed.
- Update traceability matrix with new or changed requirements.
- Save and maintain this plan in the `management-plans` folder.
