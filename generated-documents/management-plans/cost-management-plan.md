# Cost Management Plan

**Project:** Self-Charging Electric Vehicle (SCEV) - Business Strategic Plan

**Date:** October 26, 2024

**Version:** 1.0

**Prepared by:** Menno Drescher


## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the cost management plan for the development and launch of a self-charging electric vehicle (SCEV) as defined in the provided business strategic plan.  The plan focuses on managing costs throughout the project lifecycle, from research and development to marketing and sales.  The unique aspect of this project, the self-charging capability, necessitates a detailed cost breakdown across various technological and operational areas.

## 2. Project Scope and Objectives

*   Successful prototype development and testing by [Date].
*   Securing funding and partnerships by [Date].
*   Initiating mass production by [Date].
*   Achieving [Market Share Percentage] market penetration within [Number] years of launch.


# Cost Management Plan

**Project:** Self-Charging Electric Vehicle (SCEV)
**Version:** 1.0
**Prepared by:** SCEV Project Team
**Date:** [Insert Date]

## 1. Purpose
Defines policies, processes, and tools for planning, estimating, budgeting, managing, and controlling costs throughout the SCEV project lifecycle. Supports delivery of strategic objectives, innovation, and financial transparency.

## 2. Cost Management Approach
- **Estimation:** Bottom-up and parametric estimation using WBS, resource rates, and technology costs.
- **Budgeting:** Aggregate estimates to establish an authorized baseline, aligned with investment plans.
- **Control:** Monitor actuals vs. estimates, manage variances, forecast, and report regularly.
- **Value Realization:** Track cost benefits against projected value and ROI.

## 3. Cost Estimation
- **Categories:** Personnel, technology, infrastructure, training, consulting, compliance, contingency.
- **Methodology:** WBS decomposition, resource rates, benchmarking, vendor quotes, contingency for risk.

## 4. Cost Baseline



### Budget Allocation Table

| Phase         | Deliverable/Domain      | Budget Amount | Cost Element         | Source Reference         |
|--------------|------------------------|---------------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| R&D          | Technology Assessment  | $150,000      | Technology, Personnel| Business Case, Charter  |
| Pilot        | Prototype Development  | $200,000      | Infrastructure, Consulting | Business Case, Charter  |
| Production   | Full Deployment        | $500,000      | Operations, Training | Business Case, Charter  |
| Contingency  | Risk Management        | $50,000       | Contingency          | Business Case, Charter  |

This table maps the total budget amounts from the business case and project charter to specific cost elements and project phases. It provides transparency and traceability for how funds are allocated and supports financial control and reporting. Adjustments should be made as actuals are tracked and variances are managed.
- **Classification:** CapEx for assets, OpEx for operations.

## 6. Cost Control & Monitoring
- **Tracking:** Monthly actuals vs. baseline, variance analysis, value realization tracking.
- **Governance:** Cost dashboard integration, monthly stakeholder reporting, audit trail, change control for >$10,000.

## 7. Unique Project Cost Considerations
- **Sustainability:** ESG measurement, green tech premiums, reporting compliance.
- **Innovation:** Premium rates for R&D, technology assessment, regulatory compliance.
- **Risk:** Contingency management, trigger conditions, approval process.

## 8. Value Realization & ROI Tracking
- **KPIs:** Cost variance, CPI, budget utilization, value realization rate, ROI by phase.
- **Reporting:** Weekly team tracking, monthly council report, quarterly executive dashboard, annual cost-benefit analysis.

## 9. Change Management & Cost Control
- **Thresholds:** Changes >$100,000 require formal approval.
- **Authority:**
	- <$100,000: Project Manager
	- $100,000â€“$500,000: PMO Director

This Cost Management Plan is a living document, updated and revised as the project progresses and new information becomes available. Regular reviews will ensure the plan remains relevant and effective in controlling project costs.
Regular cost reports will be generated and distributed to stakeholders, including the project manager, executive team, and investors. Reports will include:


## 2a. Alignment with WBS and WBS Dictionary
- **Traceability:** All cost estimates, budgets, and controls are mapped directly to WBS work packages as defined in the WBS and WBS Dictionary.
- **Work Package Costing:** Each WBS work package (see WBS Dictionary) has a corresponding cost estimate, budget allocation, and control mechanism.
- **Budget Roll-Up:** Project phase budgets are aggregated from individual work package estimates, ensuring full coverage and alignment with the WBS hierarchy.
- **Change Management:** Any changes to work package scope or cost are tracked through the WBS and reflected in cost management updates.
- **Reporting:** Cost performance is reported at both the work package and phase level, supporting transparency and control.
