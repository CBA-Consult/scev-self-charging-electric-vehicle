# SCEV Program Management Hub Implementation Plan

## 1. Program Repo Transformation
- Update the README to clarify the program-level purpose, governance, and support role.
- Archive or migrate any legacy project-specific content to dedicated project repositories.
- Create and maintain program-level documentation:
  - Program charter, summary, change log, governance structure, KPIs, PMO documentation.
  - Portfolio index linking to all constituent project repositories.

## 2. Constituent Project Repo Creation
- For each R&D project (e.g., Solari, Kinetix, Synapse, Bedrock, Guardian):
  - Create a separate GitHub repository.
  - Include project-specific README, charter, summary, technical documentation, and change log.
  - Link each project repo back to the program hub.

## 3. Governance & Oversight
- Establish a Program Management Office (PMO) section in the program repo.
- Define governance processes, reporting cadence, and integration requirements for all projects.
- Maintain a central dashboard (GitHub Projects or Atlassian Jira) for cross-project tracking.

## 4. Documentation & Traceability
- Use markdown files for charters, summaries, KPIs, and change logs.
- Maintain a requirements traceability matrix at the program level.
- Reference and aggregate project-level documentation in the program hub.

## 5. GitHub & Atlassian Integration
- Use GitHub Organizations to group all related repos.
- Set up GitHub Projects for program-level and cross-repo issue tracking.
- Integrate with Atlassian Jira for advanced project management and reporting.
- Use Confluence for collaborative documentation and knowledge sharing.

## 6. Communication & Collaboration
- Document communication channels, stakeholder management, and escalation paths.
- Schedule regular program reviews and update cycles.

## 7. Continuous Improvement
- Periodically review and update governance, documentation, and integration processes.
- Solicit feedback from project teams and stakeholders.
