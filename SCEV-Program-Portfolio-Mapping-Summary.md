# SCEV Program Portfolio Mapping Summary

This summary maps the strategic details, values, and operational components from the legacy documentation to the program, project, and portfolio levels for the Self-Charging Electric Vehicle (SCEV) initiative.

---

## Portfolio Level
- **Vision, Mission, Purpose:** Unified vision for sustainable mobility, mission and purpose statements emphasizing innovation, energy autonomy, and environmental stewardship.
- **Core Values:** Shared across all programs and projects: Innovation, Sustainability, Safety, Integrity, Customer Centricity, Quality, Collaboration, Adaptability, Respect, Leadership.
- **Strategic Alignment:** Ensures all programs/projects align with long-term objectives, market positioning, and stakeholder expectations.
- **Governance:** Board structure, executive roles, and cross-program resource allocation.

## Program Level
- **SCEV Program:** Orchestrates multiple projects focused on technology development, user experience, sustainability, market penetration, and brand positioning.
- **Program Management:** Manages dependencies, integration, risk, and performance across constituent projects.
- **Phased Goals:** Executed in strategic phases (Technology Incubation, Market Entry, Scalability) with clear success criteria and KPIs.
- **Program Structure:** Includes R&D, Engineering, Production, Supply Chain, Quality Control, Marketing, Sales, IT, and HR divisions, mapped to the organizational chart and roles described.

## Project Level
- **Constituent Projects:** Each project (Solari, Kinetix, Guardian, Synapse) has a specific mandate (solar integration, kinetic harvesting, battery management, intelligent power management).
- **Project Objectives:** Deliver technical breakthroughs, prototypes, and IP, with KPIs and milestones aligned to program and portfolio goals.
- **Research Initiatives:** Specialized studies (e.g., pendulum energy harvesting for TPMS) managed as focused R&D projects, with clear action items, modeling, prototyping, and validation steps.
- **Departmental Roles:** Project teams structured according to the organizational chart, ensuring coverage of all necessary functions.

## Integration & Traceability
- **Core Value Mapping:** Operationalized at project, program, and portfolio levels, with traceability to Big Five personality traits for leadership and team composition.
- **Performance Measurement:** KPIs and metrics defined for every level, ensuring progress is tracked from individual projects up to the entire portfolio.
- **Action Items:** R&D tasks (e.g., pendulum optimization) documented as project-level deliverables, with results feeding into program and portfolio strategy.
